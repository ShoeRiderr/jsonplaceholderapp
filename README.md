### Json Placeholder App Demo

This app is just a playground. So don't take it serious :poop:

There ara some available features which you can execute.

For example featching dummy posts from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
You can execute it after installing the application through command prompt by typing:
```
php bin/console app:get-posts
```

There is also possibility to fetch all the posts throug the API.
This feature is available under `api/posts` endpoint.

The rest of the features are pretty intuitive. After login or registering new user you will be redirected to the list with all the posts.
